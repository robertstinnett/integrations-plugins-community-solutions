## Detailed Description

This Control-M Application Integrator job type enables the automation of character code (page code) conversion of text based files on Linux/Unix systems.  This allows you to convert from one character type encoding (such as UTF-8 w/ BOM) to another such as (ANSI Windows-1252).  This can often be useful when platforms or systems you are interacting with require specific encoding of files for processing.

The job uses the Linux command *iconv* for processing.  Therefore it must run on a Linux platform with that package installed.


The available actions are:

    Convert
        Delete Original Upon Conversion Success
        Omit Invalid Characters When Converting
